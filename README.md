# The Problem
Managing inventory in warehouses today is still plagued by manual entry errors, disjointed spreadsheets, and a lack of real-time visibility. Small to medium businesses lose hours every week trying to reconcile what they *think* they have versus what is actually on the shelf.

# The Solution
**StockMaster** is a modern Inventory Management System (IMS) designed to be the "Operating System" for your warehouse. It eliminates guesswork by providing a unified interface for tracking products, managing receipts, and handling deliveries with a clean, responsive UI.
